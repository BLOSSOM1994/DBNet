## ImageNet Pretrained Models

This is the place where the weights of pre-trained models in ImageNet are placed. This part is modified from [this repo](https://github.com/flyyufelix/cnn_finetune).

### Folder Structure
Download pre-trained weights and organize the files as follows (in `utils/weights/`):
```
├── resnet152_weights_tf.h5
├── inception-v4_weights_tf.h5
└── densenet169_weights_tf.h5    
```
